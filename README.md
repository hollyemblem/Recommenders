# Exploring Kim Falk's Practical Recommender Systems

This repo is for exploring and 'porting' Kim Falk's Practical Recommender Systems into Google Colab. It contains my notes on theory, as well as more recently some implementations of:

- Collaborating filtering
- Association rules
- Falk's recommendation engine 'boilerplate', with some refactoring to support Colab-style development.
